# DOM Events
## When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

### With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
J- avaScript can create new HTML events in the page
